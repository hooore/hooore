```
If you don't have PostgreSQL intalled in your system for development,
you can use the `seed.sh` to init the database and seed the data for you.

If you already have your own PostgreSQL setup but not yet has the schema and
the development data, maybe you can just restore the seed data.

Last, if you want to just migrate the schema, run the `migrate.js` instead.
