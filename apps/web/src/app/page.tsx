                Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Decide
                where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here. Let&apos;s
                put some highlights on these little trees. The sun wouldn&apos;t
                forget them. Let the paint work. This present moment is perfect
                simply due to the fact you&apos;re experiencing it. These things
                happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them
                happen. Here we&apos;re limited by the time we have. We&apos;ll
                take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. You want your tree to have
                some character. Make it special. I was blessed with a very
                steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you&apos;re doing
                these little delicate things.
